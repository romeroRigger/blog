Directory Crawler is a simple lightweight command-line application built in .NET C# to crawl all accessible directories within a target directory (entry point) and output the results to a text file.

I created this program because I need to monitor some shared directories within a local network.

### Screenshot

Here's how the program looked like and works, executed from Command Prompt, in animated GIF:

After the program finished running, an output text file will be created within the program base folder and if you open the text file, this is how it looked like; a list of accessible directories within the target directory.

Example (opened using Notepad2-mod app):
