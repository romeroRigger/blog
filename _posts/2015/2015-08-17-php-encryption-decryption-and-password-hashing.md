It is a software developer's responsibility to write a software that is safe for its user. Any sensitive content or confidential information that does not need to be public or searchable, that kind of data practically must not be kept in a plain text. If you are writing a custom PHP application and if you need custom function that can encrypt and decrypt any sensitive string, you may use these code snippets. These are the common custom functions I have been using when developing web application or building a PHP website to ensure any sensitive data is not easily been disclosed, including custom function for user password hashing.

### Data encryption

This is to encrypt any data string. You need to provide a password because you gonna need it when you want to decrypt back the encrypted string.

```php
<?php
function Encrypt($password, $data)
{

    $salt = substr(md5(mt_rand(), true), 8);

    $key = md5($password . $salt, true);
    $iv  = md5($key . $password . $salt, true);

    $ct = mcrypt_encrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $data, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);

    return base64_encode('Salted__' . $salt . $ct);
}
?>
```

**Example:**

```php
<?php
echo Encrypt('myPass123', 'Welcome to Flippancy 25');
// Output: U2FsdGVkX19LYv5Y5EDmFbjH8bGMDFwlid30h2x1ybibT1Dwp0vekJ0OT4tb7/j6
?>
```

Please note that, every time I execute this `Encrypt()` function, by using the **same password** and **same data string**, the encrypted string (output) is always changed as `mt_rand()` function is used for generating the _salt_.

Here are the example outputs of the encrypted string after I executed it for 3 times:-

```
// Output 1: U2FsdGVkX19LYv5Y5EDmFbjH8bGMDFwlid30h2x1ybibT1Dwp0vekJ0OT4tb7/j6
// Output 2: U2FsdGVkX1/3zxJCcE8p89t67nJNp8blNkezNxTVn4IDFQLM755K2+OSfFHewDLI
// Output 3: U2FsdGVkX18OQ8puUN8BBi+d6vAjEzDTZqM2WaKQD1atOykkYl9MY7NQM1DqI4Kw
```

Hence, even the encrypted string is changed each time I executed the encrypt function for the same input data, but it still can be decrypted to get back the original data string.

### Data decryption

This is to decrypt any encrypted string. You need to provide the right password that is used for the encryption.

```php
<?php
function Decrypt($password, $data)
{

    $data = base64_decode($data);
    $salt = substr($data, 8, 8);
    $ct   = substr($data, 16);

    $key = md5($password . $salt, true);
    $iv  = md5($key . $password . $salt, true);

    $pt = mcrypt_decrypt(MCRYPT_RIJNDAEL_128, $key, $ct, MCRYPT_MODE_CBC, $iv);

    return $pt;
}
?>
```

**Example:**

```php
<?php
echo Decrypt('myPass123', 'U2FsdGVkX19LYv5Y5EDmFbjH8bGMDFwlid30h2x1ybibT1Dwp0vekJ0OT4tb7/j6');
echo Decrypt('myPass123', 'U2FsdGVkX1/3zxJCcE8p89t67nJNp8blNkezNxTVn4IDFQLM755K2+OSfFHewDLI');
echo Decrypt('myPass123', 'U2FsdGVkX18OQ8puUN8BBi+d6vAjEzDTZqM2WaKQD1atOykkYl9MY7NQM1DqI4Kw');
// All of three above will output the same decrypted data: Welcome to Flippancy 25
?>
```

Please note that, for each encryption and decryption, they requires the **same password** to work. Else, you can't get back the original data string.

### Practical use of data encryption and decryption

**Encryption** means we want to hide something, rather than in the plain view. **Decryption** means we have the ability to get back the original data (in the plain view) that we encrypted. Basically this will be useful to work with user confidential information such as social security number, phone number, bank account number, credit card information, etc., but NOT FOR USER PASSWORD.

### Securing user password by using the hashing algorithm

Other than data encryption and decryption, password hashing is the most important security factor in developing application that needs user access. The best implementation in password hashing is to use **one-way hashing technique** which means it is no longer be able to be decrypted (irreversible). Unlike the encryptions, they are usually formulated to be able to be decrypted. However, in password hashing method we can do "encrypt" it and at the end we must hash it. You may want to check the built-in functionality [password_hash](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php) or [crypt](http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php) for PHP one-way hashing algorithms.

Most of the time, in some of my projects if I need custom password hashing, I use this function to hash the user password:

```php
<?php
function hashPassword($password, $salt) {
    $hash_password = hash("SHA512", base64_encode(str_rot13(hash("SHA512", str_rot13($salt . $password)))));
    return $hash_password;
}
?>
```

**Example:**

```php
<?php
echo hashPassword('myPa55w0rd', 'Flipp@ncy25');
// Output: 815890bb72e10a75a52087513a931afb6641a5d8d105365fa6f389f038dd81b45290a44cf94bb61e7741e073c6f4d59a16e9896bd197cc320f84f3a4d27cfb50
?>
```

Those are how I do to keep the user data secured and most importantly despite of whatever methods you're using, security is always the top priority mindset. If you are keen to learn more about password hashing, I recommend you to read [this article](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm). It is a very good article talking about salted password hashing.
