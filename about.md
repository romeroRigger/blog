Hello. I'm Heiswayi Nrird -- or just call me "Wayi" for short. Currently I work as a Software Engineer at [Keysight Technologies](https://www.keysight.com), Penang, Malaysia. I love to experiment, code and build stuffs. Sometimes, I love to capture [beautiful landscapes](https://heiswayi.github.io/my-photography/) and explore the beauty of the nature.

As I'm part of the Internet citizen, some of my stuffs[^1] that I have shared/published online can be found on these following sites:-
- [GitHub](http://github.com/heiswayi)
- [Gist](http://heiswayi.github.io/my-gists/)
