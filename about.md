I'm Mechanical Engineer, always thinking how to do more things with my computer, I worked as engineer many years in maintenance of machinery and logistics management. In my spare time, I spent a lot of nights learning more and more about Maya, Python and graphic computation, one day after many years of work almost ten as professional, I started to learn about Rigging, finally I was found my niche where Engineering and Art blend their limits.

So here I am, after many years of work, as Engineer, Manager, and Professor, trying to do a new thing in my life.
My goal "Rigging TD," when, maybe the next years, one thing is real, I wake up every day following my path, trying to make my best effort to reach my goal.
